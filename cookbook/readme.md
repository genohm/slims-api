# How to use this cookbook

**This section assumes you have already followed the instructions in the [top-level readme](../README.md) to setup your gradle.properties
and run the `./gradlew idea` command successfully**

**For extremely basic examples that can be used as jumping off points for new plugins, please see [templates](../templates)
and the [top-level readme](../README.md) in this repo**

This cookbook is intended to provide you with a series of example plugins and code samples for developing SLIMS plugins 
utilizing the slimsgate api. It is not intended to replace the slims development manual, [Apache's camel documentation](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x), 
or [Thymeleaf's documentation](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.1/usingthymeleaf.html). Rather, this is a 
supplementary set of salient examples to demonstrate how these tools can join together and interact when creating your own Slimsgate plugins.
In particular, we want to highlight how you can utilize the services provided in the `PublicApi` class. This class can be found
in your External Libraries in a directory like `/slimsservice-api-A.B.C/com/genohm/slims/server/service/PublicApi.class`. 

The `A` `B` and `C` in `slimsservice-api-A.B.C` will be a number like `6.9.0`. You might have more than one of these folders:
one is created for each version of SLIMS you have amongst your plugins' `apiVersion` values. For example, if you run `./gradlew idea`
after creating a plugin that has the following `plugin.properties` file:

```
config-class=com.genohm.slims.custom.CustomConfiguration
type=SLIMSGATE
apiVersion=6.8.0
```

An external Library `slimsservice-api-6.8.0.jar` will be downloaded, and the contained version of `PublicApi.java` will
be the one that the plugin utilizes. If you later change the version to 6.9.1 and run `./gradlew idea`, you will download a new 
external library: `slimsservice-api-6.9.1.jar`.


## What's inside?

Under the [cookbook/plugins](plugins) folder you will find several sub-folders, broken into categories:

1. [common-camel-patterns](plugins/common-camel-patterns)
   * Examples to illustrate commonly-utilized camel route designs and camel route endpoints other than "direct" routes that run some beans
   * Concepts explored:
     * [Netty](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x/netty-component.html) (TCP connection plumbing, handled by camel)
     * [Quartz](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x/quartz-component.html) (Timers, schedules)
     * [SMTP](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x/mail-component.html) (Sending emails and monitoring inboxes)
     * [File](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x/file-component.html) (Writing files, watching directories)
     * Using `SlimsGateFlowService` to start other routes
       * Creates a record and logs in the User Interface of SLIMS even if a route is not started by a SLIMS action
     * How `SlimsProxy` and `SlimsFlowInitParam` vary, depending on how the route was started
       * Started from a button being clicked in SLIMS
       * Started from a Rule in SLIMS
       * Started from a SLIMSRest API call
       * Not started from an action in SLIMS, SLIMSRest, or another route using `SlimsGateFlowService`
2. [direct-database-actions](plugins/direct-database-actions)
   * Examples for both simple and "special" direct interactions with the SLIMS database
   * Concepts explored:
     * CRUD actions - creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
     * Use of `@Transactional`
     * Making URL links to any record
     * "Special" cases:
       * Records with `Quantity` fields
       * Attachments
       * Flags
       * Providing your own `cntn_barcode`
       * Getting meta-information about Fields themselves
3. [notifications-and-emails](plugins/notifications-and-emails)
   * Examples of services that can be used to send SLIMS notifications or Emails from SLIMS Email Templates
4. [slimsgate-xml-advanced-patterns](plugins/slimsgate-xml-advanced-patterns)
   * Examples of common ways to use [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.1/usingthymeleaf.html) in slimsgate.xml files
     * Creating >1 slimsgate flows based on the plugin's configuration
     * Conditionally adding/removing XML elements based on inputs or configuration
       * For example, conditionally hiding a step, conditionally excluding certain fields
4. [ui-only-actions-as-code](plugins/ui-only-actions-as-code)
   * Examples of how you can utilize services from `PublicApi` to perform actions available in the UI that do more than just
        a simple CRUD action on the Database
   * Versioning records
   * Enrolling contents in biobanking Studies
   * Blocking positions in locations
   * Updating/Scheduling Orders
   * Creating requests with Requestables
   * Acknowledging Rule evaluations
   * Automating or skipping E-signatures
   * Protocol Run & Workflow actions
     * Starting a run, 
     * Popping contents from a queue into a run
     * Finishing steps
     * Completing/closing the run
     * Re-queuing contents from a run
   * Label Printing
   * Generating a report from a report template
   * Generating Excels, XML, TXT, and CSV files from Grid templates and thymeleaf
   * Importing a SLIMS-formatted excel import file via a plugin
